Using the Zinc HTTP library available by default in Pharo, get the pharo logo
from http://pharo.org/files/pharo.png. Convert it into a morph and open it in
Pharo. You should obtain something similar than the picture below.

Hints:
• The class ZnEasy offers several handy messages to ease HTTP requests.
• The message asMorph converts low level graphical elements (form)
into Morph (graphical objects).
• The message openInWorld open graphical objects.
